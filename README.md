### Why this repository?
**This is my first university assignment for "Web development introduction" module.**
The assignment requirement is: _"create a HTML file and write the basic HTML5 structure, then just insert a h1 tag and my name in it"_.
Yeah, it's that easy. So I decided to add some styles and animations, just... _why not?_

The HTML file contains the styles and scripts using its HTML tags **(&lt;style&gt;, &lt;script&gt;)**, it's a completely mess but I decided to make it like this, since I could only send one file in order to complete the assignment.
Also I'm aware that I skipped some conventions and good practices but I didn't know that I'll create a repository **(since after all I liked the final result)**, in addition to that I wanted to take the freedom to develop the page without following rules.
_It was funny!_
